INTRODUCTION
============

CLANN stand for `C library for Learning Appliance and Neural Networks`.
Its was developed in a mastering engineering course of Artificial Neural
Networks at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN) [0]. In this
course we have a very extensive and intensive teaching in both supervised and
non-supervised learning techniques. The choice of C language was made based on
its fastness, portability and embeddable capabilities. Mode information about
CLANN can be find in its site:

BUILD
=====

CLANN is mainly designed to be a static incorporable library, but its perfectly
possible use it as dynamic library too. So, the process of compilation depends
on its use. To make the examples in ./test/ directory just type make in CLANN
root directory.
